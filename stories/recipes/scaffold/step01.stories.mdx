    <p>In this Recipe, we will create a full SPA with web components.
      We will have all the fixings for a great meal. Routing, localization, bundling,
      linting, unit testing, environment variables, file structure, architecture
      and what ever else we can fit.

### Prequisite

While no expert knowledge is needed there are numerous steps to scaffolding a
site from the ground up.  Before each topic feel free to research a bit more about
a tool or process we will be using.

It is expected that you already have a perference of `IDE(a.k.a Code editor)` and
knowledge of using a `console` and/or `shell terminal`, `Git`, `Node.js` and `NPM` which is required to continue.


### Expected Results

What we hope to appcomplish is a full front-end workspace for developers
to add code, lint, test and bundle everything so it can be deployed. We should be
able to bundle the application so it can be served and hosted on the web.

>This starter can be used for projects of all sizes.

## Initial Files

We need a set of initial files.  When creating your new repo there is likely a `README.md` file.
This will be important to update at the end.  If your project does not have one make sure to create one.

Before We create each file lets understand why it is needed.


| File | Reason |
|:---------|:---------|
| README.md | Vital documentation as to what the project is about and how to use it. |
| .editorconfig | Helps your IDE(a.k.a Code editor) know how to format the code |
| .gitignore | Required to inform Git what files to ignore and not be checked in |
| package.json | Required to install dependencies, provide project information and execution scripts |
| src/main.js | Our starting application JavaScript file |
| src/index.html | Our Base application HTML file |
| webpack.config.js | The config for bundling the application |


Create a **.editorconfig** file and add the following:

```
# Editor configuration, see http://editorconfig.org
root = true

[*]
charset = utf-8
end_of_line = lf
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2
insert_final_newline = true
trim_trailing_whitespace = true

[*.md]
max_line_length = off
trim_trailing_whitespace = false
```

This is a good starting **.gitignore** file.  Feel free to add any other folders/files
needed.
```
# IDE
._*
.cache
.DS_Store
.env
.envrc
.idea
.npmrc
.project
.settings
.scannerwork
.tmproj
*.esproj
*.sublime-project
*.sublime-workspace
nbproject/
Thumbs.db
.vscode/*
.vs/*
!.vscode/tasks.json
!.vscode/launch.json
!.vscode/extensions.json

# extensions
*.diff
*.err
*.log
*.orig
*.rej
*.swo
*.swp
*.tgz
*.vi
*.zip
*~

# Folders
node_modules/
coverage/
dist/*
```

We can start with a basic **package.json** file and add our dependencies as we build our
scaffold.

```json
{
  "name": "my_app",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "build": "./node_modules/.bin/webpack --mode production --config webpack.config.js",
    "build:dev": "./node_modules/.bin/webpack --mode development --config webpack.config.js",
    "start": "./node_modules/.bin/webpack serve --mode development --config webpack.config.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
}
```

From the root of the project create a folder called `src/` and within that folder a file called `main.js`.

```js
function component() {
  const element = document.createElement('div')

  element.innerHTML = `<h1>Hello Mettle</h1>`

  return element
}

document.body.appendChild(component())
```

Within the same `src/` folder create an **index.html** file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <title>Getting Started</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <noscript>
      <!-- No JS alternative -->
    </noscript>
  </body>
</html>
```

For the last initial file lets create **webpack.config.js**.

> Note this configuration is for **Webpack 5**

```js
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin')
const { resolve } = require('path')

module.exports = (env, argv) => {
  const IS_BUILD = env.WEBPACK_BUILD
  return {
    devServer: {
      historyApiFallback: {
        rewrites: [
          { from: /.*\.html?/, to: '/' },
          { from: /^[\w/]+$/, to: '/' },
        ],
        verbose: true
      },
      host: '0.0.0.0',
      open: true,
      port: 2022,
    },
    entry: './src/main.js',
    module: {
      rules: [
        {
          test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|jpeg|gif)$/i,
          type: 'asset/resource',
        },
        {
          test: /\.html$/i,
          exclude: /index\.html$/i,
          type: 'asset/source',
        },
      ],
    },
    output: {
      assetModuleFilename: 'assets/[name][ext]',
      clean: true,
      filename: 'main.js',
      path: resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    },
    plugins: [
      new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
        base: IS_BUILD ? false : '/',
        inject: 'body',
        template: './src/index.html',
        scriptLoading: 'module'
      }),
    ],
  }
}
```

Before we can test we will need to install some dependencies.  Make sure all files above
are created and saved.

Install these from the command line like so:

> Note the indicator for the shell command **$** is removed for easy copy and paste

**devDependencies**
```sh
npm install html-webpack-plugin webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server --save-dev
```

**dependencies**
```sh
npm install @johnsonandjohnson/mettle-components --save
```

### Final Results for Initial Files setup

Once this is all configured we will be able to start our application.  Run the following
command.  This was configured in the `package.json` file scripts section.

> All scripts should be executed where the `package.json` file is located.

```sh
$ npm start
```

You should see the application open from your default web browser and display something
that looks like this.
<img src={ScaffoldStep1} class="img-border" height="200" />


The current file structure should look something like this
```
.
├── node_modules
├── src
│   ├── index.html
│   └── main.js
├── .editorconfig
├── .gitignore
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── webpack.config.js
```

## Before starting the next step

In the terminal enter `ctrl + c` to end the process. The webpack development server
will shut down.
