    <p>In this Recipe, we will go over mixins.  These helper properties and methods are a good way to reuse code use down to a single source.

#### Prerequisite

Be sure to have an understanding of JavaScript classes and inheritance.

### Expected Results

What we hope to accomplish is to have a class with reusable properties and methods
for any custom elements we create.  The goal is to take methods and properties
that are consistently copied over and over and place them into a class for
reusability.  This pattern allows for a single source of truth and maintainability.


### The Base Mixin

The base code for a mixin is a function that returns a class that extends
the functionality from another class.  This allows for multiple mixins
to be applied to one class.


```js
export default Base => class extends Base {

  constructor() {
    super()
  }

}
```

#### Sample use

```js
export default Base => class extends Base {

  $formElement = null
  constructor() {
    super()
  }

  getFormData() {
    return Object.fromEntries(new FormData(this.$formElement))
  }

  setupFormValidation($form) {
    this.$FormElement = $form
    this.$formElement.addEventListener('submit', event => event.preventDefault())
    ...
  }

}
```
The downside to this is there can be a clash of method or properties which will
end up overriding each other. There is also the ambiguous
methods or properties that will be used without knowing the reference or origin.


We solve this by utilizing JavaScript Symbols to create namespaces for the
methods and properties.  This solution solves the ambiguity and namespace clashing
only at the expense of some developer readability.


Lets use an example of wanting to create a form validation mixin.
The namespace definitions will look something like this.

```js
export const MixinNS = {
  $formElement: Symbol('$formElement'),
  getFormData: Symbol('getFormData'),
  setupFormValidation: Symbol('setupFormValidation'),
}

export default MixinNS
```

We can then create the mixin like so

```js
import MixinNS from './mixins.namespace.js'
export default Base => class extends Base {
  [MixinNS.$FormElement] = null
  constructor() {
    super()
  }

  [MixinNS.getFormData]() {
    return Object.fromEntries(new FormData(this[MixinNS.$FormElement]))
  }

  [MixinNS.setupFormValidation]($form) {
    this[MixinNS.$FormElement] = $form
    this[MixinNS.$FormElement].addEventListener('submit', event => event.preventDefault())
    ...
  }
}
```

### Custom Elements

Using mixins with custom elements will make development faster and maintainability better.

All custom elements must extend from the `HTMLElement` interface. We can apply our mixins
to this interface before finally extending it to our custom element.

```js
import { HTMLMarkerMixin, SubscriptionMixin } from 'Mixins'
import { updateService } from 'services'

const HTML = '<p>Last Update: ${update}></p>'
const BASE = SubscriptionMixin(HTMLMarkerMixin(globalThis.HTMLElement))
const TAG_NAME = 'update-table'

if (!window.customElements.get(TAG_NAME)) {
  window.customElements.define(TAG_NAME, class extends BASE {
    constructor() {
      super('')
    }

    async connectedCallback() {
      await this[MixinNS.HTMLMarker].render(this, HTML, this[MixinNS.DefaultDataModel])

      this[this.MixinNS.Subscription].push(
        updateService.subscribe({
          next:this[MixinNS.onModelUpdate].bind(this)
        })
      )
      updateService.getUpdates()
    }

    get [MixinNS.DefaultDataModel]() {
      return Object.assign(Object.create(null), {
        update: '',
      })
    }

  })
}
```

### Final notes

There might not be a lot of use cases for mixins.  Many of the custom elements used for
development should be project base.  Like above the custom elements might include services
to display or collect information from/to the user. We use the `HTMLMarkerMixin` to easily
implement the ability to render values that change efficiently.  We use the `SubscriptionMixin`
to remove observables and avoid memory leaks.  In the case of `OnRemoveMixin` it is not
tied to a service and is used without dependencies.

> Mixins should be used to implement a pattern for custom elements to follow.
